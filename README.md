# Kenten Generic

Kenten Generic is a special-purpose OpenType/CFF font that provides glyphs suitable for typesetting emphasis marks, which are referred to as "kenten" (&#x570F;&#x70B9;) in Japanese, hence the name of this OpenType/CFF font.

## Building the font from source

### Requirements

To build the binary font file from source, you need to have installed the [Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html) (AFDKO). The AFDKO tools are widely used for font development today, and are part of most font editor applications.

### Building the font

In this repository, all necessary files are in place for building the OpenType/CFF font, and the COMMANDS.txt file provides the command lines that are used.

## Getting Involved

Send suggestions for changes to the Kenten Generic project maintainer, [Dr. Ken Lunde](mailto:lunde@adobe.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Kenten%20Generic), for consideration.
